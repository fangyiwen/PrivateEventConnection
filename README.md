# Private Event Connection
CS5520 Final Project

## App Description
There is always a time that we want to get connected with groups and attend online/offline events. However, we would like only to join and share the moments with our closest friends or someone we have known each other in real life. Today and Now, try the app, Private Event Connection, to meet people in the same organizations in real life and do anything you want with them, e.g., learning, sports, and hiking. Your security is guaranteed since no one, except who is from your organizations, can get access to the group you belong to and get connected with you. Download the app to discover events hosted by people around you, or start a group to schedule your own events.

Play with someone you trust and feel safe
* Groups and events are only accessible to the members of your organizations in real life
* Keep a small circle of friends, instead of public social networking
* Be completely relaxed to enjoy trust and safety

Start groups or events
* Create a group corresponding to an organization you are in reality and see it grows
* Join an existing event or create a new one to hang out with people you may be familiar with or strangers but safer to get in touch with
* View events from a map marked with your events or a list that display all at once or by group
* Use messaging to connect with people who join the same event with you

Contact us if you have any questions or suggestions: fang.yiw@husky.neu.edu

Sensors highly recommended
* We need to use your GPS sensor to obtain your location information in order to locate you or give location recommendations when filling in an event location by the time you create an event
* We need to use your camera to take a photo of you when you create your profile photo
